== Description ==

Automatically creates an image banner with the heading of the latest post, for use on web sites or as a signature in discussion forums.

The banner image is contstructed from a template image of any size, on top of which text with a user-selected typeface, color and placement is placed at each time a new post is published (or the latest post is updated).

With the use of the image banner as a forum signature you can provide a way of always advertising your latest post on the discussion forums you frequent. The plugin automatically provides bbCode and HTML appropriate for use as signature code for most discussion boards.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder `osiris-signature-banner` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Make sure the uploaded folder is writeable (chmod 666)
3. Upload a template image (preferably in PNG format) to the uploaded directory
4. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
5. Optional: Upload a font file in TTF format to the uploaded directory
6. Input the appropriate settings, including the name of the font file in step 5 if you selected to perform this step.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is my text not showing? =

If you are getting a signature image without text (completely black if you use the default template) it's because of a bug in the positioning. Set "Right Position" to something that is not -1 (50 for example) to position the text inside the image. This is fixed in the next version that is coming soon.

= Where can I get new fonts? =

I downloaded the ones included in the plugin from http://www.dafont.com/. There are loads of sites that provide free fonts.
